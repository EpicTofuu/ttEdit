TTedit 0.1
===============================
Consists of both viewer and writer. 
Run ttEdit.py to run both the viewer and the writer.
It is possible to just run the writer by itself.

How to use
====================================
-First, put in the sequence of lines your school follows in the file named "lines.txt"
-The viewer will not run without a timetable.json file present, if one is not present, run the ttEditWriter.exe and press save to write a new file
-timetable.json is both machine readable and human readable

The programs are made to be run side by side, make changes to the file using the writer and click on the viewer to update.
