# ttEdit
Timetable creator

Create a school timetable with relative ease

# How?
1) fill in your school's sequence of lines in the "lines.txt" file, so far, the program is only really made for my school's timetable
2) open the ttEdit.py file. Ensure that python is correctly installed on your machine and the file associations are correctly configured, opening the file should allow direct access to the program
3) use the C# GUI to write in the subjects and the python GUI to view the timetable. there is no screenshot option just yet, just use snipping tool

The C# GUI probably will not work on non-windows operating systems. You are completely free to just edit the subjects.json yourself.
